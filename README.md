# CRAFTING A MODERN RESTAURANT WEBSITE WITH REACT.JS

The project skillfully utilizes React, a popular JavaScript library, to construct a modular and responsive web application. It harnesses various Reactstrap components, such as Container, Row, Col, ListGroup, and ListGroupItem, to structure and style the layout. Notably, Bootstrap classes like pb, mb, pt, ps, w, d-flex, align-items-center, justify-content-between, text-center, align-items-start, gap, and list-group are employed throughout the components for consistent and responsive styling. The "Home" React component serves as the central layout for a web page, seamlessly integrating multiple components, including "Header" for navigation, "HeroSlider" for a prominent banner, "PopularMenu" for showcasing popular food items, "ChooseUs" for highlighting benefits, "MenuPack" for displaying categorized menu items, "Testimonials" for customer reviews, "Download" for promoting app downloads, and "Footer" for comprehensive site information. React's essential concepts, including functional components, useRef, which is utilized in the Header component to create a reference to the navigation menu, enabling the toggling of CSS classes for menu animation. State management facilitated by the useState, which is utilized to manage and update state variables, such as 'filter' and 'products' in the MenuPack component, for dynamic rendering and user interaction and useEffect hook, which is employed in the MenuPack component to execute code based on the changing 'filter' state, enabling dynamic content updates without direct user input  and modularization through the use of Fragment, play a central role. This architectural approach ensures a maintainable and user-friendly web application, prioritizing responsiveness and modularity.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
